1.	Differences between front end and back end

Basis	Front End	Back End
Definition	Front end development involves the effective implementation of visual components of a web application	Back end development involves the effective implementation of functions of a web application that includes databases, server management, etc.
Skills Required	The skill set required for the front end includes  HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, etc.	The skill set required for the back end development includes Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, etc.
Independence	Front end development cannot work independently except in the case of static sites.	Back end development works independently of the front end 
Goal	The goal of the front end development is to ensure that the application is accessible by everyone.	The goal of the back end development is to ensure that the application runs under all the provided cases, be scalable, and work efficiently.
Development Team	The work of the front end development team is to design and develop the appearance of the application based on the user’s input and test it.	The work of the back end development team is to assist the front end in linking pages up, provide security and support to the users.
Frameworks Used	AngularJS, React, vue.js, etc.	Django, Flask, CakePHP, Laravel, Ruby on Rails, etc.
Additional skills	A good understanding of UI and UX designing.	Logical reasoning and problem-solving.




2.	Differences between UI/UX


     Basis 	UX	UI
Purpose	Design a complete product from a human-first perspective.	Create a product’s aesthetic experience from a human-first perspective.
Application	Digital and physical products	Digital products only
Focus	A fully immersive, pleasant user experience from start to finish.	A series of visual touchpoints that let users easily interact with the product.
The Creation Process	Developing structural design solutions that address potential issues consumers may encounter with the product.	Combining buttons, color palettes, images, and typography.

3.	Differences between library and framework

S.No	            Framework            	            Library            
1.	It comprises of lot of APIs , compilers , support programs , libraries etc.	It is a collection of helper modules , classes , objects , functions , pre-written code , etc.
2.	It is difficult to replace frameworks.	A library is easy to be replaced with another library.
3.	A framework development requires a lot of code that decrease performance and increase the load time.	Building a library requires less code , so there is better performance and fast load time.
4.	Including framework into an existing project is impossible.	Libraries can be integrated easily into existing projects to add some specific functionality.
5.	Framework examples are AngularJS , Spring , NodeJS , etc.	 Library examples are JQuery , React JS , etc. 




4.	ReactJS / AngularJS whether library or frameworks

    React JS is a library and Angular JS is a framework.


5. Differences between mobile applications and web applications.


Mobile Apps	Web Apps
Need to download via an appropriate app store, which makes them less accessible to users.	Web applications are accessible instantaneously on browsers.
Flexible User interfaces and support complicated functionalities.	Can’t support complicated functionalities.
Patches/ Updates need to be downloaded from Play Store.	Updates/ Patches are applied straight to the entire web app.
While mobile application needs installation, they give faster navigation with shorter load times by obtaining the system’s resources.	Web application speed can depend on the internet connection quality, with poor connectivity leading to failing to load or extended loading times.
The build cost for mobile apps is higher than a standard web application.	The development cost for web apps is lesser than a common native mobile app.


6. Differences between website and webpage.


Website 	Webpage  
Website is a collection of webpages displayed on the web with a client-like browser. 	It is part of website that includes information and content and is displayed on the browser to user.
It contains more than one web webpages that contain information.	It is a single document display on the browser.
It is a combination of webpages created using HTML and CSS.  	Information is usually written in HTML language.  
It requires more time to develop the website as compared to webpages.  	It requires less time to develop a webpage as compared to the website.  
There is no extension included in the URL of the a website.  	URL of webpage include extension.  
It is complex to create the structure of the website and its programming.  	It is quite easy and simple to develop web page after website structure is being created.
